Cyber Attack Detection
Modern-Low-Footprint-Cyber-Attack-Detection

This project aims to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between bad connections, called intrusions or attacks, and good normal connections. Used the folowing Models to detect bad connections (intrusions). Compare the accuracy, recall, precision and F1-score of ALL the models.

• Logistic Regression • Nearest Neighbor • Support Vector Machine • Fully-Connected Neural Networks
